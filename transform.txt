Transform property: 

  // transform  {translate(x ,y)}
    means moving elements around in css, from it's natural positionial origin. (top left top corner)

  // transform {scale(x,y)}
    used to change the size 
    naturally it scales from the center

    ****  use transform-origin  ****
    it scales in a more logical order

  // transform: {rotate(deg)}
    ** transform origin: center **
    w/ transform-origin: `here`

    when using multiple transform prop, keep them on the same line - do not call again on diff line, it will overwrite the transform prop before it.
